## ●　PRPJECT OBJECTIVES<br>
>This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## ●　USAGE
#### Preparation<br>
・main.c<br>
```
#include "srcs/ft_printf.h"

int main()
{
	ft_printf("%s\n", "apple");
}
```

#### Compile<br>
1) `$ make` in root dir to generate libftprintf.a<br>
2) `$ gcc libftprintf.a main.c` to generate a.out<br>
3) `$ ./a.out` to implement program
